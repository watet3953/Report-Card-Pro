 a) What is its title?

 b) What will the project achieve?
Providing an easy way to store, process, modify, and print marks for report cards.

c) What is the user required to do?
Input marks, class names, and student names.

d) What are some of the given facts?
Each student has a name and four classes, which each have a grade and a mark

The program should be hopefully intuitive enough that basic use will be obvious to the user, but for more complicated things such as potential conditional support a manual may be required.

Global variables will likely not be needed between "tabs", data can be loaded during tab switch.

-on button press, Given an edited format, save it to a format specific file (?)

-on button press, given a file and a format (possibly already loaded into the program), convert it to a printable format and save/print. (via openable menu)
