**Class number (i,e Course1) reads in as null, but somehow adds new name to the end of the old name (Course05, Course012)**

Bug did not respond to changes in adding code until shown to others, when it responded perfectly to a very simple fix. resolved.


**When class 0 is removed, adding new classes becomes impossible**

class 0 remove button disabled, all new classes have the button enabled on creation.
